``ll.la`` provides a Python API for the LivingApps system
(see http://www.living-apps.de/ or http://www.living-apps.com/ for more info).

``ll.la`` allows you to fetch the configured data sources from a template,
create new records, and update and delete existing records all from your Python
prompt (or script).
